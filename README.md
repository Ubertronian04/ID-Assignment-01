# ID Assignment 01: Personal Portfolio Site

This project is about creating a personal portfolio website from scratch. The website's purpose is to serve as a platform to promote myself and the technical skills I used in the process. The contents of the website will cover facts and information about me so that any potential employer that comes across it will understand me better.

_This project was done as an assignment for the Interactive Development module in Ngee Ann Polytechnic._

## Design Process

In this section, I will go over my design process and design elements implemented.

As mentioned above, this project is to create a website for personal branding purposes. As a employer, I would want to be able to easily view an individual's portfolio such as background, skills, experience and others, so that I can decide whether they should be a candidate for hiring.

With this in mind, I designed a [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5c9a7b52-5ff3-4dd2-8a6b-3bba49ac067b-09c9/) for my website to be able to easily view my portfolio as well as some of my personal interests and values in a systematic manner. I included 4 pages of content to my websites, which are the home page, about me page, portfolio page and contact page.

I also tried to recreate some designs and layouts that I previously used in my first personal branding website (link at bottom of page) and improve on it to make my website more interactive.

The colour scheme uses 2 main colors of pink and white. I used mostly 2 colours to create a slight contrast between the two. This would make the words visible enough while also creating a softer and cleaner effect throughout the website. Initially, I was going to choose a shade of blue instead of pink as seen in the wireframe created. However, with a friend's recommendation, I swtiched it to pink.

## Features

In this section, I will explain the features of my website and list down some additional features that could be implemented to make the website more functional and interactive.

### Existing Features

- Navigation bar - allows users to navigate between different pages of the website by clicking on each page's label. The current page is shown through an underline below the label.

- Personal Gallery - allows users to view photos and by hovering over an image, it displays the context of the photo.

- Socials - allows users to go to my social media account(s) by clicking on the image correlated to the platform.

- Contact Form - allows users to easily ask me inquiries by filling up the form and submitted it

### Features Left to Implement

- Contact Form (functional) - allows users to actually utilise the form to ask me inquiries that I will receive. Currently, the form does not have anywhere to submit its information to.

- Slideshow Gallery - allows users to use buttons on the side of the "Personal Gallery" section to view more pictures. An additional feature to this would be to show a larger display of the current photo selected.

## Technologies Used

These languages are the technologies used in the creation of this project.

  - Used to create the body and layout of the web pages
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  - Used to style and format the web pages
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - Used for input validation and interactive features

## Testing

This section covers the testing of features and their intended output when a user's action is taken.

1. Navigation Bar:
   Using the navigation buttons at the top left of the screen...

   1. Go to "Home" page
   2. Go to "About me" page and ensure the correct page is loaded
   3. Go back to "Home" page
   4. Repeat step 2-3 starting from all the different pages and testing each navigation button on each page to check if the right page is loaded

2. Personal Gallery:

   1. Hover over each photo and verify that a description of the photo appears on the center of it.

3. Socials:

   1. Click on the logo of social media platform (i.e. LinkedIn) and verify that it goes to my profile page (Chiam Wei)

4. Contact form:

   1. Go to the "Contact" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that an error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with alphabets in the Phone No. section and verify an error message appears
   5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a modal popup appears

### Display

This website works and displays correctly on most devices. The exception is devices with screen sizes less thant 320px (if any). In smaller devices (below 1000px), all content within the website will be convert to a column layout if it is not already done so.

### Bugs & Issues

As mentioned in the "Features Left to Implement" section, the contact form is unable to submit and does not return any values. This is due to the fact that there is no external file to save the information stored in the form (i.e. a php file).
