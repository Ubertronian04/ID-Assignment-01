# ID Assignment 01: Personal Portfolio Site

This project is about creating a personal portfolio website from scratch. The website's purpose is to serve as a platform to promote myself and the technical skills I used in the process. The contents of the website will cover facts and information about me so that any potential employer that comes across it will understand me better.

_This project was done as an assignment for the Interactive Development module in Ngee Ann Polytechnic._

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

These languages are the technologies used in the creation of this project.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  - Used to create the body and layout of the web pages
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  - Used to style and format the web pages
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - Used for input validation and interactive features

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

**This website works and displays correctly on most devices. The exception is devices with screen sizes less thant 320px (if any). In smaller devices (below 1000px), all content within the website will be convert to a column layout if it is not already done so.**

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
