            <p>Hi, my name is Chiam Wei. To describe myself very simply, I am a introverted but competitive person. 
                I spend a lot of time in front of my phone or laptop screen watching clips, videos and other types of entertainment online. 
                Being exposed to technology from my mother's work and various platforms since young, I have developed an interest in learning IT at a more advanced level. 
                Therefore, starting with small steps here at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I want to further develop my skills and knowledge in IT.</p>

        <section id="bottom-aboutme-section" class="aboutme-section">
            <p>The goal of my current education journey is to gain enough experience and knowledge with multiple software and programming languages to become a software engineer or a web application developer. 
                I may not be quite self-driven but I constantly strive to complete duties assigned to me. 
                This mindset of mine also applies to team projects. Looking at myself objectively to an extent, I like to work independently and this can sometimes affect the teamwork within the group. 
                Thus, I always strive to better myself and become a reliable person to work with.</p>
