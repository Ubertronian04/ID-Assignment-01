            <p class="portfolio-content">November 2020 - December 2020<br><br>
                WAREHOUSE PICKER/PACKER, WATSONS<br><br>
                I worked as a warehouse picker and packer under Watsons for about 1 and a half months. This was my first 
                work experience so it really taught me much about the workplace that I previously didn't know. It was a 
                physically-straining job but very rewarding at the end of the day. I would say this was a great introduction to 
                the working world.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-content">February 2021<br><br>
                CNY FESTIVE HELPER/PROMOTER, F&N<br><br>
                During the Chinese New Year (CNY) celebration period, I worked as one of the many promoters for CNY goods and promotions under F&N. 
                I was stationed at the Fairprice outlet @JEM as the only temporary staff working for F&N. 
                It was difficult working alone for the most part, with some supervisors checking in from time to time. 
                However, I truly learnt the importance of being professional even when no one is looking. 
                This experience helped strengthen my sense of duty.</p>

                This is the place I am currently pursuing my diploma in Information Technology at. 
                This school will be very different from the general education I received during my secondary and primary school years. 
                As the curriculum will be more focused and work-oriented, I hope to gain the skills and knowledge I need for my future career during my time here</p>

                I pursued my O level qualifications here to receive a higher education in the future. 
                However, it was also a place where is experienced part of my youth and gain insight into my self-development. 
                I learnt about leadership, teamwork and independence among many others. 
                This educational institution taught me more than just the syllabus and I am grateful to every classmate, teacher and staff who guided  me through this journey.</p>
